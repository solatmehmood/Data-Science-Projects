- Data analysis: Calculate statistics like mean, median, and correlation between variables.
- Visualizations: Generate line, bar, and scatter plots to explore trends.

## Libraries Used:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization
